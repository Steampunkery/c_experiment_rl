Overview:
---------
This roguelike is a passion project of mine that has been through many
iterations in many programming languages. Currently, it is written in C,
using Flecs, GLib, Uncursed, and my Dijkstra Map library.

Dependencies:
-------------
To build this project, you'll need the following shared libraries:

1. GLib >= 2.72.4
2. Uncursed from NetHack4

Building:
---------
Once you have these dependencies, simply use the makefile to build the
project. The following targets are supported:

default, roguelike: the whole project
flecs: build only flecs
dijkstra: build only the dijkstra lib
clean: delete object files

Tests:
------
Currently only the Dijkstra Map library has a test. It can be found in the
lib/test directory
