Overview:
---------
This roguelike is a passion project of mine that has been through many
iterations in many programming languages. Currently, it is written in C,
using Flecs, Uncursed, and STC as external (but built-in) dependencies.
The other libraries: Dijkstra, rlsmenu, and sockui, are written by me
for this project, so I don't consider them external dependencies.

Dependencies:
-------------
To build this project, you'll need:

1. gcc and g++
2. A modern Linux machine

Building:
---------
Once you have these dependencies, simply use the makefile to build the
project. The following targets are supported:

default, all, roguelike: the whole project
uncursed: only uncursed
rlsmenu: only rlsmenu
flecs: only flecs
dijkstra: only dijkstra
sockui: only sockui
clean: delete game object files
fclean: remove game and library object files

Tests:
------
Currently only the Dijkstra Map library has a test.
